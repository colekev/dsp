[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

>> First babies are lighter (mean 7.20 lbs) than others (mean 7.32 lbs).

>> The Cohen's d between the two groups is -0.089 (pos 0.089 if you make the heavier "others" group1).

>> The effect size, as measured by Cohen's d, is larger for birth weight than for pregnancy length (0.29), though not particularly significant.
