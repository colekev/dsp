[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> The PMF and CDF plots don't have a completely random, i.e. equally distributed shape. But, it's most likely a function of a smallish sample (1000), where larger sample of 100,000 or greater would appear close to perfectly random in the plots.
